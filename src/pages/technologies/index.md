        One of the Little Endian expertise is Node.js. We develop project with Node.js for a wide range of applications, from IoT in embedded devices to large scale applications deployed in cloud and hybrid clouds. For large scale applications we typically create microservices architectures, both for containers enviroment than for bare metal deployments. We offer our expertice both for creating solutions from scratch and for refactoring existing applications.

        Python is for us the army knife, we use it in a huge amount of applications.  One typical use case is for web backends (with Django or Flask as framework), but also in IoT applications in devices and data processing pipelines. We use Python also for educational purposes, creating courses for kids and for adults who will to learn to code.

        We can define ourselves early Flutter adopter. Developing mobile apps is historically a pain if you need to manage many platforms (mainly iOS and Android). There are many hybrid frameworks out of there but, after year of tries, we foud Flutter as the one that get closer to the "one code base, multiple targets" promise. For customers whom needs a mobile app with short time to market Flutter is a great choice and we offer a very good skills with it.

        One of our preferred deployment environment is Kubernetes, when the requirements fit in a microservice architecture, containers based, Kubernetes is the orchestrator we choose. We are able to offer design and implementation of Kubernetes architecture or help our clients to migrate old applications to it. We offer also monitoring and full cluster management as service when required.

       MongoDB is another preferred choice for a lot of scenarios and use cases. It perfectly fits in modern architecture, where data isn't bound with a static structure but instead needs high dynamism. It's highly supported by the tools we use and very scalable, we help customer both in adopting it from scratch than migrating old RDBMS based projects.

       ESP32 and ESP8266 are perfect IoT devices, equipped with wireless connectivity, GPIO and connectivity, small and cheap. There is a huge amount of companies that are adopting those devices for many use cases. LittleEndian is the best partened for companies willing to create product based on those devices, given our experience on developing firmware for them we are able to implement a solution from scracth, perfectly integrated with the client needs.

      doing the right thing even before I asked for it.

      I asked LittleEndian a very challenging IoT project, I was struggeling since some months, trying hard to 
      make the project with other companies, without success. Asking for it to LittleEndian has been a game changer, 
      we delivered the project and it was a success, thanks guys!
