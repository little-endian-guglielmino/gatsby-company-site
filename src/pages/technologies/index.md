        One of the Little Endian expertise is Node.js. We develop project with Node.js for a wide range of applications, from IoT in embedded devices to large scale applications deployed in cloud and hybrid clouds. For large scale applications we typically create microservices architectures, both for containers enviroment than for bare metal deployments. We offer our expertice both for creating solutions from scratch and for refactoring existing applications.

        Python is for us the army knife, we use it in a huge amount of applications.  One typical use case is for web backends (with Django or Flask as framework), but also in IoT applications in devices and data processing pipelines. We use Python also for educational purposes, creating courses for kids and for adults who will to learn to code.

        One of our preferred deployment environment is Kubernetes, when the requirements fit in a microservice architecture, containers based, Kubernetes is the orchestrator we choose. We are able to offer design and implementation of Kubernetes architecture or help our clients to migrate old applications to it. We offer also monitoring and full cluster management as service when required.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
