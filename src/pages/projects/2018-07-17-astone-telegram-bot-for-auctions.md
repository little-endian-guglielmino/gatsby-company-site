## The Challenge 

This is a project born from an internal idea, a lot of times was asked us to develop solutions to manage auctions. There are a lot of auctions applications, typically web based, but we wanted to do something innovative, exploiting the power of Telegram, a platform that we appreciate a lot.

## The Solution

We developed this telegram bot as a platform to serve both users, willing to publish auctions than users that want to bid for items.

With [Astone](https://telegram.me/AstoneBot) user can create an auction from Telegram itsef, is in place an approval process to avoid publishing contents that can infringe copyright or other rules.

When an auction is approved, a start date and time is set. When auction starts, Astone creates an engagement experience, with the pressure given by the same experience a user can live going to a real auction.

##Â The outcome

The outcome is a proof of concept that is used as starting point for a lot of custom projects. Occasionally the original bot is updated bringing to it some improvements.

The original project is released as open source [here](https://github.com/guglielmino/astone-bot)
