## The Challenge 

LittleEndian was engaged to create a solution creating a device and a platform to monitor and control lighitng system. The solution is an enanchement for the lamps made by the client, those lamps are sold to offices, malls and any other indoor building. Problems solved by introducing a level of smartness to those lamps are:
- alerting on failure
- compsuntiong monitoring
- remote control

## The Solution

Time to market required by the client was challengig because his customers were migrating to competitors already equipped with smart lighting systems, even though we provided a solution made of some parts:

- Firmware for the ESP32 device control and power meter device (hardware design made in collaboration with the client)
- Edge computing application
- Core backend layer implementing API and device communication
- Single Page Application frontend

##Â The outcome

LittleEndian delivered a full IoT solution, from the device to the cloud based platform, that improved the client experience in managing lighing systems for large offices and mall. The main outcome for the client was a significative cost saving in the first year, so big that the investment in the development of the plaform was totally covered by it.
