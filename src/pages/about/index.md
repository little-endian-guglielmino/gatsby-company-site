### Direct and transparent
Our way to work is based on **direct** and **transparent** relationship with the customer. We use tools to share projects status, sources, release notifications and so on, directly connecting the customer with us.

### Committed

We work on a wide range of [technologies](/technologies), providing both development from scratch or support on existing code base for cloud migrations, refactoring, performance and security tuning.
