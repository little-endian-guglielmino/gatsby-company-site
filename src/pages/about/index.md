### Custom sofware development
A lot of companies make software but only a small part of the do **QUALITY SOFTWARE**. That's our goal: providing the customer with the best possible software solution.

### Direct and transparent
Our way to work is based on **DIRECT** and **TRANSPARENT** relationship with the customer. We use tools to share projects status, sources, release notifications and so on directly connecting the customer with them.

### Sopporter
Little Endian mission is to **SUPPORT** the customer, helping him to bring a project from the idea to the deploy. We work on a wide range of (technologies)[/technologies], providing both development from scratch or support on existing code base for cloud migrations, refactoring, performance and security tuning. 

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
